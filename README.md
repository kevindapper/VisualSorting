# VisualSorting
Small visual sorting program created using JGrasp. GUI components coded manually. Code written by classmates Quentin Howa, Alex Robertson, and Kevin Dapper. Project shown at SLCC's 2019 Fall Jamboree
# Motivation
Final project for CSIS 1400 class at SLCC. The project was picked to challenge my classmates and I to explore algorithms and GUIs which were not covered in class. 
# Build Status
The files available are for the final state of the project. 
# How to use
Pick an array length from given prompts, then a sorting algorithm. In a JFrame, the visual portion of this program will run showing the algorithm run.
